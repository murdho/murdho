I'm a software engineer using mainly **Go**, **Ruby**, **Clojure**, **SQL (PostgreSQL)** in production.

Also exploring **Zig** and **Rust** out of curiosity and enjoyment.

:pager: **[pi-read-meter](https://github.com/murdho/pi-read-meter)** — **Go CLI application** that ran on Raspberry Pi, automatically took photos of gas meter and uploaded those to Dropbox, so I can report the number easily while living abroad

:moneybag: [**payment_schedule**](https://github.com/murdho/payment_schedule) — **Ruby DSL** describing and easily maintaining payment schedules (is/was used in production in an actual :bank:)

:package: **[rack-cargo](https://github.com/murdho/rack-cargo)** — **Ruby gem** for adding batch requests support to Rack apps (works with Rails, Roda, Sinatra, etc)

:crystal_ball: **[something.rb](https://gist.github.com/murdho/11396c47af7be7742f251a0c7ee2e571)** — **Ruby mini-puzzle** for fun. **Can you solve it?** :wink:
